# Invoicer
This repository is a collection of tools that I personally use to generate invoices.

So far, the repository is organised in two folders:
- **inv-tools:** The heart of the invoicer. This is the core invoice tools.
- **clinv:** A program for generating invoices via the command line.

I'm currently in the process of creating a desktop application called `sainv` which 
is a standalone invoicing application.

Currently, the command line tool is sufficient for my invoicing needs, however, a GUI
would be nice, hence why I'm creating sainv. 

See the individual README's within each folder to learn more about them.
